# Neuromodulatory-Control-Networks
Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture have achieved remarkable success, yet their core processing mechanisms remain largely static after training. While powerful, this static nature limits their ability to dynamically adapt their processing strategy based on nuanced contextual cues, task demands, or desired operational modes (e.g., shifting between exploration and exploitation). We propose Neuromodulatory Control Networks (NCNs), a novel architectural modification inspired by the neuromodulatory systems in the vertebrate brain (e.g., those utilizing dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine). NCNs are small, parallel networks that receive contextual input, summarizing the global state, task information, or external control signals, and compute dynamic "modulatory signals". These signals are broadcast to the main LLM to influence its computational properties during a forward pass, analogous to how neuromodulators alter neuronal gain, plasticity, and network states. Instead of merely routing information, NCNs aim to change how information is processed throughout the base model by modulating key components like attention mechanisms (e.g., temperature), layer gains, and activation functions. This paper introduces the NCN architecture, details its components and potential mechanisms, discusses its conceptual advantages for enhancing LLM adaptability, controllability, and efficiency, and provides an open-source PyTorch implementation to facilitate community exploration and future empirical validation.
